line 74
bool static_cond = false;
what is the meaning of this condition?

line 75
bool pa = false;
What is the role of this variable? "pa" is called in line 205 in order to solve the final linear system.

line 76
const char *device_config = "cpu";
what is the meaning of this condition?

line 78 
bool algebraic_ceed = false;
what is the role of algebraic_ceed? 

line 81
args.AddOption(&mesh_file, "-m", "--mesh","Mesh file to use.");
are these strings different ways to call the mesh?

lines 92
#ifdef MFEM_USE_CEED
this condition is necessary to input algebraic_ceed. What kind of condition is it?

line 115
Mesh mesh(mesh_file, 1, 1);
what are second and third aguments representing?

line 116
int dim = mesh.Dimension();
is the mesh dimension the dimension of the domain or the the number of functions in the solution space?
theoretical question: is the given set V a basis for the solution space? is this the refering diimension?

line 124
(int)floor(log(50000./mesh.GetNE())/log(2.)/dim);
mesh.GetNE (Returns number of elements.) it depends on mesh.NumOfElements
it is counting the number of elements. How we can interpreted the formula for ref_levels

what is an isoparametric/isogeometric space?

line 144
fec = mesh.GetNodes()->OwnFEC();
what is it doing?
what type of object is mesh.GetNodes? is it a kind of boolean condition? (see line 142)

line 155
<< fespace.GetTrueVSize() << endl;
theorical question: please clarify the concept of true dof.

line 157
comment
are essential boundary dof the dofs associated to the independent dofs of the space functions which are not
zero on the boundry.

line 162
Array<int> ess_tdof_list;
what kind of array is it?

line 162
if (mesh.bdr_attributes.Size())
what is the meaning of attribute in this context?
the argument is related with a boolean concept?

line 175
b.Assemble();
what does assemble do?

line 180
GridFunction x(&fespace);
x=0.0;
does x contained the linear combination coefficients?

if (pa) { a.SetAssemblyLevel(AssemblyLevel::PARTIAL); }
what is the pa variable?

line 190
what is AMR and static condentation?

line 209
PCG(*A, M, B, X, 1, 200, 1e-12, 0.0);
is M a matrix? if yes, is M=A (in the mathematical sense)? and are you implemented this in order to do a faster
process?

line 222
if (algebraic_ceed)
what is algebraic_ceed?

line 247
ofstream sol_ofs("sol.gf");
what is the meaning of the extension .gf?
