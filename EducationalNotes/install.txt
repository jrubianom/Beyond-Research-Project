See Readme and Install files in MFEM documentation.
However, if you are not acquainted with downloading code from the source or if you
have probems with spack, you can install this script written by my friend
Carlos.

Download the files CONFIG_MFEM, which contains:

a file install.sh
a file Makefile
a directory code
a file local_config.mk
a hidden dir .objects

Suppose that we are in Foo directory and we have the files of CONFIG_MFEM in Foo.

mkdir mfem_dir
cp sh install.sh mfem_dir
cd mfem_dir
sh install.sh

After the installation you will find in mfem_dir/fem/build the installed library
and compiled
and in mfem_dir/fem/fem you will find all the source code.

If you want to check, then run:
make examples
make miniapps
make test

Now, you can create an other directory in which you could use mfem. Compile mfem
requires a lot of flags. For that reason, it is useful to have a makefile that
automatizes the compilation process.
You can follow these instrucctions:

cd Home/../Foo
mkdir Work_dir
mv code Makefile local_config.mk Work_dir
mv .objects Work_dir
cd Work_dir

open the local_config.mk file and change thjis line with your corresponding path directory
(in which you have installed MFEM):

MFEM_INSTALL_DIR = /home../Foo/mfem_dir/mfem


If you want to run some examples of MFEM in this directory, with the mesh of the
examples, you will have to copy here (in Work_dir) the directory data (Which is
in mfem_dir/fem/fem), and put the .cpp files in the dir code.

Finally run, for example if the name of .cpp is foo.cpp:
make file='foo'
